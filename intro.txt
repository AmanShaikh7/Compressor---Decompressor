Sir/Maâ€™am,

My full name is Aman Ajaz Shaikh. I was born and brought
up in Ahmednagar,maharashtra. However,due to my clg i was

currently i am pursing a full time B.Tech 
in Computer Science from MIT ADT university ,Pune
 that will complete in Jul-2022. My CGPA till last sem is
 7.9 out of 10.

My Computer Science degree(s) is giving a range of skills
 that I feel are crucial for my career and life.
 Despite limited exposure, I have understood that
 hard work and determination can make anything possible.
 I am ready to do that.

I interned with Softtech Data Securities for 6 Month(s) 
in total and contributed to the Detection of morph images
using Ml. 

and i have also internsed with xebia for 3-4 months
 and from their learnt a skill such as api develpoment
 and managment and learnt a technology named mulesoft.

when it comes to my projects we have done a 
project known as intellegance advertisment system 
using deep learning techniques
and also published the research paper for the same .

When it comes to schooling, I have done my 12th from
 Ahmednagar clg ,ahmednagar and secured 69% in my 12th 
in 2018 .
And i have completed my 10th from sacred heart convent
 high school and secured 78%. During my schooling, 
I developed strong communication skills and also had 
the opportunity to participate and excel in several 
extracurricular activities.
Because of these exposures and experiences during my
 academic years, I have gradually been able to develop 
effective communication skills
.So, I can interact freely within a team.

To add, I am also skilled in Python, MySQL, C++,
Machine Learning, Deep learning ,Data Structures, 
OOP concepts.

Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from
my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me
ahead in both my professional and personal life.
